  <h1> Why free education should be free for everyone </h1>
  <h2> Written by : Mohamad Faris Aiman Bin Mohd Faizal 2111809 Section 8 of UNGS 1201 </h2>
  <p>  As we all learned in class about Sustainable Development Goals, education is the fourth one on the list of goals. The goal is it aims to â€œensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
    I'll be discussing on why free education should be adopted globablly in every country."
  
  </p>
  <p> With the economy changing substantially in the coming years and years, tuition and educational costs have risen dramatically across the country.
    As a result, many families across the country are facing financial difficulties and must decide whether or not to send their children to college to pursue a good education. Something needs to change in order for families to be able to use that resource economically,
    therefore "What is the best method for individuals to afford a decent education at a lower cost?"
  </p>
  <p>
    This, I believe, would have a significant impact on many families with children who have recently graduated from high school and are eager to further their education.
    In order to pursue a strong career in the work market, many organisations require a higher degree as a benchmark.
    If the cost of education were to decrease, everyone would benefit since individuals would be able to afford it more easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people do not want to be in debt due to student loans, which PTPTN and other organisations charge for borrowing their money,
    which is one of the reasons why this shift in our education is necessary.
    This money is being accumulated at an alarming rate that most people cannot afford.
    Due to the large quantity of debt that needs to be recovered from students, such effects might lead to people going bankrupt and causing financial damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    As some may say that affordability is a reason why education should be free,
    others agree that it is better for our economy to be highly educated and if you do not meet this standard,
    opportunities are very limited for you to be able to afford a certain lifestyle.
    An opportunity to which every human has the equal right to reach their full potential.
    The world is changing at a breakneck pace, necessitating the use of people with sophisticated skills or knowledge to execute routine tasks.
    This gives rise to the idea of a more educated employment market, which will aid in our economic progress.With the advancement of human technology,
    we will soon learn that many organisations are replacing human labour with robots capable of doing common activities as the industry norm.
    This allows CEOs to save money by reducing the amount of payroll they must pay to employees who perform their duties.
    The issue is that many individuals will be unable to buy basic essentials in order to live a human lifestyle as a result of this.
    This way of life necessitates people having the flexibility to showcase their abilities, skills, and experiment with new ideas,
    all of which leads to happy people. A successful population would result from more happy people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another argument for why a free education is advantageous is that the government is not maximising its resources.
    The ability of resources to lead to medical breakthroughs, economic progress, and technological improvement.
    As an alliance between different governments is crucial to the world's culture,
    these benefits would allow our country to have the ability of a higher power as an advantage over other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason is that while affordability is a key concern for many individuals,
    the playing field has not always been level when it comes to attending college.
    Although many of the world's best minds originate from low-income families,
    this should not prevent them from finishing their education.
    Everyone would have the opportunity to attend school if there was an equal opportunity to do so.
    Affordable education is a significant step toward achieving equality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, it can improve our society overall.
    People who are better educated are better able to address challenges.
    As a result, civilization can advance at a faster pace.
    People with education can also better comprehend their society's history and current economic problems.
    As a result, individuals may be more likely to get involved in politics and help their country.
    In addition, as more people obtain a college education, the number of people who are marketable for high-skilled employment grows.
    More people will enter the labour as a result, perhaps narrowing the wealth gap between the upper, medium, and lower classes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great reason for education to be free is 
    because there is still more technology and more to explore, education should be free.
    We can do it very quickly with free education, and the future can alter right now.
    We need education to solve the problem of consuming less gas on our globe, which means less pollution,
    and we can rescue the earth with the education we have received. 
  <p>
    With so many arguments to support the idea that higher education should be free for all,
    the list could go on and on. Tuition-free education has a number of advantages, including affordability,
    economic growth, medical breakthroughs, and technological advancement.
    The increased development of human life will benefit the entire planet if the populace is highly educated.
    All of this, however, will be impossible if education is not affordable or free to those families who choose to send their children to higher school.
